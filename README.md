<h1>Multi-Selection RecyclerView</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Multi-Selection RecyclerView app! This app demonstrates the use of the SelectionTracker class to create a behavior of multi-selection of items in a RecyclerView. The multi-selection is triggered by long clicking on an item, and then additional items can be selected simply by clicking on them (without the need for long clicks). This behavior can be useful in many different types of applications.</p>
<p>Some features of the app include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multi-selection behavior: The app uses the SelectionTracker class to allow the user to select multiple items in the RecyclerView by long clicking and then clicking on additional items.</li>
  <li>Demonstration of SelectionTracker: This app demonstrates the use of the SelectionTracker class to implement a useful and intuitive multi-selection behavior in a RecyclerView.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that you find the Multi-Selection RecyclerView app helpful in implementing similar behavior in your own projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
